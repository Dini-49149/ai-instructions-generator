AI Instructions Generator - Reverse Engineering Human Expertise

A breakthrough system that automatically generates AI instructions by analyzing how human experts successfully extract information from legal documents. Instead of manually writing extraction rules, this system studies successful human decisions and reverse engineers them into reusable, precise AI instructions.

ðŸŽ¯ Key Features:
â€¢ Reverse Engineering Intelligence - Learns from human success patterns
â€¢ 8-Section Instruction Format - Comprehensive structured approach  
â€¢ Semantic Gap Analysis - Advanced failure diagnosis and refinement
â€¢ Cross-Validation Framework - Ensures instruction quality preservation
â€¢ LangGraph Workflow Engine - Sophisticated state management and routing
â€¢ Production Web Interface - Gradio/Streamlit frontend with Flask API backend

ðŸ”§ Technology Stack:
â€¢ Backend: Flask, LangChain, LangGraph, PostgreSQL, Redis
â€¢ Frontend: Gradio/Streamlit with real-time progress tracking
â€¢ AI Models: OpenAI O3 (generation), GPT-4 (extraction/evaluation)
â€¢ Infrastructure: Docker, Docker Compose, multi-stage containerization

ðŸš€ Use Cases:
â€¢ Legal document processing and OCG (Outside Counsel Guidelines) analysis
â€¢ Expert knowledge capture and democratization
â€¢ AI instruction quality assurance and refinement
â€¢ Legal compliance automation and document intelligence

Perfect for legal professionals, AI researchers, and organizations seeking to automate expert-level document analysis while maintaining human-quality accuracy.
